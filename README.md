## 📌 **Project Title: Event Management System**

### 📝 **Project Description:**

The **Event Management System** is a dynamic web-based application developed to streamline the process of planning, organizing, and managing events. This system is designed using **PHP** for server-side scripting, **HTML/CSS** for frontend structure and styling, **JavaScript** for interactivity, and **MySQL** as the backend database to store and manage event-related data.

The platform provides a user-friendly interface for both **event organizers** and **attendees**. Organizers can create, update, and manage event details, while users can browse upcoming events, register for participation, and receive event-related updates.
